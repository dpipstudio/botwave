We highly recommand using the official installer (Check the [main README](/README.md)) -- If you don't want to or are not using a Linux distribution, find how to install it by yourself. (Tip: on windows, use wsl)

## Usage
To start the BotWave Client, use the following command:

```bash
sudo bw-client <server_host> [--port PORT] [--upload-dir UPLOAD_DIR] [--skip-checks] [--pk PASSKEY] [--skip-update-check]
```

### Arguments
* `server_host`: The hostname or IP address of the BotWave Server.
* `--port`: The port on which the server is listening (default: `9938`).
* `--upload-dir`: The directory to store uploaded files (default: `/opt/BotWave/uploads`).
* `--skip-checks`: Skip system requirements checks.
* `--pk`: Optional passkey for authentication.
* `--skip-update-check`: Skip checking for protocol updates.
