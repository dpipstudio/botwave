# Handlers documentation

## Overview
Handlers are scripts that execute specific commands based on certain events. They are stored in a designated directory (default: `/opt/BotWave/handlers`, can be specified by using the --handlers-dir option) and must follow specific naming conventions and formatting rules.

## File Naming Conventions
Handler files must start with specific prefixes and have the correct file extensions:

- **Prefixes**:
  - `l_onready`: Executes when the system is ready. | `Local client`
  - `l_onstart`: Executes when the system starts. | `Local client`
  - `l_onstop`: Executes when the system stops. | `Local client`
  - `s_onready`: Executes when the system is ready. | `Server`
  - `s_onstart`: Executes when the system starts. | `Server`
  - `s_onstop`: Executes when the system stops. | `Server`
  - `s_onconnect`: Executes when a connection is established. | `Server`
  - `s_ondisconnect`: Executes when a connection is terminated. | `Server`
  - `s_onwsjoin`: Executes when a websocket connection is established. | `Server`
  - `s_onwsleave`: Executes when a websocket connection is terminated. | `Server`

- **Extensions**:
  - `.hdl`: Standard handler files.
  - `.shdl`: Silent handler files (no log messages for command execution).

## Handlers editor
BotWaves comes shipped with our own file validator and checker, named `bw-nanld`. Run it with `sudo bw-nanld <filename>` to automatically create the handler and validate input once you finished editing it. 


## File Formatting
Each line in a handler file represents a command to be executed. Ensure that:

- Each command is on a new line.
- Commands are clear and concise.
- Empty lines are ignored.

## Example Handler File
Here is an example of a properly formatted handler file named `s_onready.hdl`:

```plaintext
command1
command2
command3
```

## Silent Handler Example
Here is an example of a silent handler file named `s_onready.shdl`:

```plaintext
silent_command1
silent_command2
silent_command3
```

## Directory Structure
Ensure that all handler files are placed in the correct directory as specified by the system configuration. The default directory is typically named `handlers_dir`.

## Logging
- Standard handler files (`.hdl`) will log messages indicating which commands are being executed.
- Silent handler files (`.shdl`) will not log these messages.

## Error Handling
Errors during the execution of handler files will be logged. Ensure that commands in handler files are tested and validated to minimize errors.
