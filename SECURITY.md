# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of this project seriously and encourage users to responsibly report any vulnerabilities they discover.

Our primary focus is on vulnerabilities that impact **system integrity**. For example, the server should not be able to access anything beyond the BotWave client components, and the client should not be able to access unauthorized server resources.

Please **do not** use the issue tracker for security reports. The [/issues](/issues) section is reserved for standard software bugs and feature requests.

If you discover a security vulnerability in BotWave, please report it responsibly by contacting us at [`admin@dpip.lol`](mailto:admin@dpip.lol)

Please note that we do not currently offer a bug bounty program.
